We proudly present our 'Create A Playlist' web app. 

This app uses the LastFM music API which allows the user to search for songs to add to a custom playlist.
Once the user commences a search, a result is displayed allowing the user to confirm it is the song they are looking for.
The user can then add the song to the playlist. 

Within the playlist the user is able to re-order each song (drag & drop), remove a song, and rename the playlist.

The user is also able to email the song to an email address of their choice (through their own email client) that will list the songs in the body of the playlist.
